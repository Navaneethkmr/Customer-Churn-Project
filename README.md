# Customer-Churn-Project

Churn (loss of customers to competition) is a problem for companies because it is more expensive to acquire a new customer than to keep 
existing one from leaving. This problem statement is targeted at enabling churn reduction using analytics concepts.

I have implemented machine learning models in R & Python to predict and reduce the customer churn for a telecom company.
